## Description

Within this backend application it allow for a manager of a company to use updated technology to manage the ecommerce (internet retail). Using express, sequlize, and other node packages the user can easily manipulate and test the information within the database. This application allows you to test the database using expresses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. I have also added a demonstration that can be viewed.

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated the substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.
