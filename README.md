## Description

Within this backend application it allow for a manager of a company to use updated technology to manage the ecommerce (internet retail). Using express, sequlize, and other node packages the user can easily manipulate and test the information within the database. This application allows you to test the database using expresses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. I have also added a demonstration that can be viewed.

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated the substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

## Installation

In order to run this application via the backend for manager or developers first you must ensure to have neccessary applications installed.  The applications include [**VS-Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [**Gitbash**](https://gitforwindows.org/),[**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/download) as well as the latest version of [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Next, in order to run the appropriate tests and data, I had to *Follow these steps:*

**1.** Within my project directory I am using the Node Package Manager. I installed this by typing `npm i` into the CLI.

**2.** This application uses information for a database, So I used the *mysql2* package by installing the package by typing `npm install mysql2` into the cli.

**3.** Within this application a secure password was used to connect to the database within the code so I used the .env file to hide credentials. To install the proper usage of this package I typed `npm install dotenv` into the CLI.

**4.** In order to test the competency of the application you must connect to a local host using express.  Install the express package by typing `npm install express` into the CLI.

**5.** Lastly in order to efficiently manipulate data in the database we used NPM's sequelize. To install this package simply type `npm install sequelize` into the CLI.

Your package.json file should contain the following dependencies:
